function [index] = calcIndex(w, w_min, w_max, N)
% returns index correspoding to a serial
% number of section in which argument w gets into if space between w_min
% and w_max is divided into N sections.
    
    % input arguments:
    % - w

    dw = (w_max - w_min)/N;
    w_n = w - w_min;
    n = floor(w_n/dw);
    index = n;
