		The procedure for working with the program:
1. Copy the spectrum under study in * .txt format to this directory.
2. Delete the header in the spectrum file - so that only 2 columns with numbers remainè.
3. Set initial constants in main.m manually, including the file name, set checkout = 1.
4. Estimating the discrepancy between the calculated spectrum and the experimental one, 
evaluate the new values of the initial constants and manually correct them.
5. Repeat step 4 several times (to facilitate auto-tuning).
6. Start automatic tuning by setting checkout = 0 parameter. 

Note:
Convergence adjustment is possible through constants in the corresponding section.
(lines about 90-100)

copy.txt - source spectrum (an example)
mod.txt - roughly cut line
mod1.txt - precisely cut the line (in proportion to its weight)
